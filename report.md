## Team Management
#### Use of version control
#### Meeting organisation
#### Work division
Work was divided evenly between all members of the team based on strengths and prior experience. The fact that some team members were together in person at the time of project commencement and some were not also impacted work division. In person team members worked together to produce the main code components, and those who were virtual adopted the equivalant of a Quality Assurance role, carrying out tests on the code and suggesting improvements with an objective eye as they had not been involved in its production. <br> Documentation such as this report and any linked documents was a team effort, completed by the team members most familiar with a certain section and peer assessed by other team members to ensure quality, clarity and detail were maintained. <br>

#### Choice of programming language
As a team we decided to complete the entire project in python, as all team members have previous experience with the language, and thus felt more confident using it than C or PowerShell.

#### Software development approaches
We decided to use the "Comment Driven Development" approach, in which the entire project is pseudocoded using comments before being written in full python code.  This allowed us to plan the code thoroughly before beginning, reducing the amount of times sections needed to be rewritten due to unforseen requirements, and refining the implementation to be as efficient as possible befoe development began.  A further benefit was that the implementation of different sections could be properly discussed with the entire team before they were implemented, preventing miscommunication and better facilitating the integration of code sections written independently by different team members.
